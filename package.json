    "description": "AWS Step Functions AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the\ncomponents of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.\n\nYou can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components,\neach of which performs a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and\nchange applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps\nvisualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step\nFunctions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when\nthere are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right\norder every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly\ndiagnose and debug any issues.\n\nStep Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your\napplication is available at any scale. You can run tasks on AWS, your own\nservers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can access and use Step\nFunctions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information\nabout Step Functions, see the AWS Step Functions Developer Guide\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html] .",
